Project Requirements

- Your project should document at least one HTML or CSS topic. In our example project, we documented the tags and attributes used in HTML tables layouts, but you can choose any HTML or CSS topic that you’ve learned so far—the sky is the limit!

- Your site uses HTML tables to display the documentation. Be sure to label the columns in your HTML.

- Your site should utilize a custom color scheme. You can use any of the named CSS colors.

- Your site should use custom styles for any code such as HTML tags or CSS properties or values (like font-family). Represent code using a monospace font family and a different background color.
